Sha bang or hash bang is the first line of the bash script.
It determines which shell should be used to execute it.
If it is not mentioned , some bash functions may not work properly.
It is ususlly "/bin/bash" or "/usr/bin/bash"

Some keywords on bash script are:
    1.If
    2.then
    3.else
    4.elif
    5.fi
    6.for 
    7.do 
    8.done
    9.while
    10.case
    11.esac
    12.declare
    13.until
    14.select
    15.time
    16.coproc

Some looping statements are as follows:
    
    1.
      for [[ Expression ]];do
          #For loop statements
      done
                    (or)
      for name [ in [words ...]]; do commands ; done
                    (or)
      for (( expr1;expr2;expr3 )); do commands ; done

    2.
      while [[ Expression ]]
       do
          #while loop statements
      done

    3.
      until [[ Expression ]]
      do
          #while loop statements
      done

The conditional statements are as follows.
    1.
        if (( Expression ))
        then
            #consequence commands
        fi

    2.
        if (( Expression ))
        then
            #consequence commands
        else
            #consequence commands
        fi

    3.
        if (( Expression ))
        then
            #consequence commands
        elif (( Expression))
            #consequence commands
        else
            #consequence commands
        fi

    4.
        case word in 
            pattern1 ) command list ;;
            pattern2 ) command list ;;
            * ) #for all other cases (derfault case) command list ;;
        esac

    5.
        select name [in words ...];do commands break ;done

    
Grouping commands in bash:

    Bash provides two ways to group list of commands.
    1. ( list )
        Placing a list of commands between parentheses forces the shell to create a subshell .
        And each of the commands in list is executed in that subshell environment. 
        Since the list is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes.

    2. { list; }
        Placing a list of commands between curly braces causes the list to be executed in the current shell context. 
        No subshell is created.
